    "title": "Manchester City winger Ferran Torres hits hat-trick",
    "Brief": "Manchester City winger Ferran Torres scored his first career hat-trick as Spain inflicted Germany's heaviest competitive defeat and joined France in the four-team Nations League finals.",
    "content": "In a repeat of the Euro 2008 final, former Chelsea forward Alvaro Morata headed in Spain's first goal, before Torres volleyed home emphatically.\r\n\r\nRodri made it three with a guided header, and Torres slotted in a fourth before curling home the fifth.\r\n\r\nMikel Oyarzabal's tap-in made it 6-0.\r\n\r\nSpain and France will be joined by either Belgium or Denmark from Group A2 and Italy, the Netherlands or Poland from Group A1.\r\n\r\nSummer bargain Torres shines\r\nIt was a game that Spain dominated from the off - having 70% possession and 23 shots - but it was 20-year-old Torres who stole the show.\r\n\r\nHis fast, intelligent movement and eye for a goal has impressed in the opening weeks of the season, and his performance here strengthened the idea that Manchester City may have got a bargain after only paying an initial �20m for his services.\r\n\r\nHis raw pace and trickery set up an incorrectly disallowed Morata goal, before he showed composure to set himself and volley home his first.\r\n\r\nHis second again demonstrated excellent technique, as he controlled a cross that was behind him before slotting underneath Manuel Neuer.\r\n\r\nHe saved the best for last as he superbly curled home from the edge of the area to take his international tally to four goals.\r\n\r\nHis performance will have delighted fans in the blue half of Manchester, with the man he replaced at City, Leroy Sane, completely ineffective for the Germans.\r\n\r\nThe only setbacks on a fantastic night for Spain were muscular injuries to captain Sergio Ramos and Sergio Canales. But manager Luis Enrique said both injuries were \"of very little importance\", adding \"it is not pleasant for the clubs\".\r\n\r\nLow has major work to do\r\nGoing into the game, Germany were unbeaten in 2020, and in control of Group A4.\r\n\r\nThey needed to avoid defeat to reach the finals and while that situation can sometimes lead to confusion about how to play, they were below par throughout.\r\n\r\nThey failed to register a single shot on target, with Serge Gnabry coming closest when his 22-yard effort rebounded off the bar in the dying moments.\r\n\r\nIt was a night filled with questionable tactical decisions, as Chelsea forward Timo Werner played wide left, with Gnabry through the middle in an uninspiring first-half performance.\r\n\r\nManager Joachim Low was given the chance to rebuild the side after elimination from the 2018 World Cup in the group stages, but with his side ranked 13th in the world, this performance suggests he has significant work to do before next year's rearranged European Championship.\r\n\r\nLow said he didn't \"know what really happened\", but said he still trusts in the players.\r\n\r\nHe added: \"Today we saw that we are not as far ahead in our development as we had thought and expected after the last games.\"",

I want this escapism for all children.\"\r\n\r\nMacmillan said the scheme would see a large number of books being given away to children from vulnerable and under-privileged backgrounds.\r\n\r\nRashford added: \"We know there are over 380,000 children across the UK today that have never owned a book, children that are in vulnerable environments. That has to change.\"\r\n\r\nA spokeswoman for the publisher said it would work with Rashford and charities to \"find the most effective mechanisms to reach the children who need them\".",

A strict nationwide lockdown that was imposed on 21 March delayed the spread for a while, but infections grew rapidly - and continue to do so - since restrictions were relaxed.\r\n\r\nA major challenge in India's fight against Covid-19 has been the false and misleading information around the pandemic, which is often shared at lightning speed.\r\n\r\nSince the first infections were reported earlier this year, millions of people with smartphones have received hundreds of messages each about supposed cures, lockdown rumours and conspiracy theories on Covid's origins. Claims that frequently sipping warm water, shunning meat and poultry, or taking homoeopathic medicine could prevent infection have regularly landed in people's inboxes.\r\n\r\nFear and carelessness have seen people flouting orders to wear masks in public places or maintain social distancing. In some places, frontline workers, including doctors and nurses were attacked, even barred from their own homes by neighbours fearful of catching the virus.\r\n\r\n\"Through this campaign, we wanted to challenge misinformation, dispel fear, and support the health workers and others at the forefront of the fight against the virus,\" Ram Devineni, the Indian-American creator of the Priya comic series, told the BBC.",
